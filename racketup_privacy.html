<h3 id="security-measures">5.2. Security Measures</h3>
<p>We take reasonable precautions to protect your information from loss,
misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
These measures include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Passwords are hashed using encryption,
and sensitive data transmissions are protected by HTTPS.</li>
<li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to personal data is limited
to authorized personnel who require such access to operate, develop, or
improve our Service.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> We perform regular security reviews
and updates to ensure the integrity and security of our systems.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="retention">5.3. Retention</h3>
<p>We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to

<h2 id="your-rights-and-choices">6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<h3 id="account-access-and-updates">6.1. Account Access and Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewing and Editing:</strong> You may access, update, or
correct your personal information by logging into your account and
adjusting your settings.</li>
<li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your
account and associated data by contacting us at the email address
provided below. Please note that certain information may need to be
retained for legal or security purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Account Deletion Process:</strong> When you delete your
account, we use a “soft delete” approach that anonymizes your personal
information while preserving the integrity of match history and league
data. Specifically:
<ol type="1">
<li>Your personal information (name, email, bio, height, weight) is
either anonymized or removed.</li>
<li>Your username is changed to “Deleted Account” and your profile
picture is removed.</li>
<li>Your account is marked as deleted with a timestamp.</li>
<li>Your friends list is emptied, but your account remains visible as
“Deleted Account” in other users’ friends lists.</li>
<li>All pending friend requests involving your account are removed.</li>
<li>Your notifications are deleted.</li>
<li>Your match history and statistics remain in the system to maintain
game integrity and other users’ records.</li>
<li>Your league memberships remain, but your username shows as “Deleted
Account” in league rosters and match history.</li>
</ol>
This approach ensures that deleting your account doesn’t break the
application’s functionality for other users while still respecting your
privacy by removing your personal information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communication-preferences">6.2. Communication Preferences</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Opting Out:</strong> You can opt out of receiving marketing
communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in our emails.
